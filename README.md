## Quickstart

Starting with your Ruby or Rails project, no Bun or anything like that required:

```sh
bundle add bundlebun
rake bun:install
```

and then:

```sh
> bin/bun ...
Bun is a fast JavaScript runtime, package manager, bundler, and test runner. (1.1.38+bf2f153f5)

Usage: bun <command> [...flags] [...args]
...
```

## Rationale

**Modern frontend setup is needlessly complex** and may involve a lot of maintenance. Developers need _at the very least_ a JavaScript runtime (typically, Node.js), a package manager (could be npm, yarn, or pnpm), and a build tool (Vite, Webpack, esbuild, Parcel—dozens of them).

- One way forward is to dockerize development environments, creating unnecessary headaches for the development team—both frontend and backend engineers (especially if the team is not that large and the project is not that complex).
- Another approach is to declare front-ops bankruptcy and pursue the "no-build" route.

**What if we could simplify this?** **Bun** is a **JavaScript runtime**, optimized for speed and developer experience. Bun is _also_ a fast JavaScript **package manager**. Bun is _also_ a **build tool**. Bun is also distributed as a single executable file.

However, Bun still requires [some installation](https://bun.sh/docs/installation), and we need to make sure everyone on the team is using the same version.

So, how about we just pack it into a Ruby gem as a binary and allow developers to stay updated? Then, we'll be ready every time a new Bun version is out—or the user can freeze their desired version within their Ruby project. There are no setups, large READMEs with instructions, and no enforcing the Docker workflow.

**Enter bundlebun**. With a fast JavaScript runtime and a package manager included, you can even skip the build tool and use Bun itself.

## Install

bundlebun gem releases include a binary distribution of Bun for each supported Bun platform (macOS, Linux, Windows) and architecture.

First, add it to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "bundlebun"
```

and:

```sh
bundle install
```

(or just):

```sh
bundle add bundlebun
```

If you're seeing a message like `Could not find gems matching 'bundlebun' valid for all resolution platforms
(aarch64-linux, aarch64-linux-gnu <...> )`, this may be [a known issue with Bundler/`Gemfile.lock`](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=Could+not+find+gems+matching+all+resolution+platforms) which you can fix. Open `Gemfile.lock` in your text editor, find a section called `PLATFORMS`, and alter a list of platforms you need to support. This can be a good default for most if you're targeting Linux and macOS (for Windows, also leave entries with `x64_mingw`):

```
(rest of the file here)

PLATFORMS
  aarch64-linux
  arm64-darwin
  x86_64-darwin
  x86_64-linux

(rest of the file here)
```

... and try `bundle install` again.

Next, run:

```sh
rake bun:install
```

The task will install a binstub (`bin/bun`) that you can use to run Bun commands; try running `bin/bun` or `bin/bun --version`.

You should use `bin/bun` in your scripts, including your local runners like `Procfile.dev` or `Procfile`, and `package.json`—if you had a call to `node` or `bun` in the `scripts` section there.

Next, the Rake task will try to detect the integrations we need to install based on the classes and modules Rake can see in your project. We'll continue with integrations.

### Integrations

`rake bun:install` will detect already-loaded gems and run the corresponding installation tasks.

Alternatively, you can ensure an integration is loaded and the necessary modules are patched by calling methods that look like `Bundlebun::Integration::IntegrationName.bun!`: more on that below.

#### Ruby on Rails: cssbundling and jsbundling

[cssbundling](https://github.com/rails/cssbundling-rails) and [jsbundling](https://github.com/rails/jsbundling-rails) are Rails gems that support the traditional CSS and JS building pipeline for Ruby on Rails.

Be sure to check both gems for documentation on bootstrapping your frontend build pipeline (as bundlebun supports them) instead of duplicating approaches. cssbundling, for instance, includes an excellent sample build configuration for Bun.

To quote their READMEs, try this for cssbundling:

```sh
bundle add cssbundling-rails
bin/rails css:install:[tailwind|bootstrap|bulma|postcss|sass]
bin/rails css:build
```

and this jsbundling:

```sh
bundle add jsbundling-rails
bin/rails javascript:install:bun
```

To install the bundlebun integration, run

```sh
rake bun:install:rails
```

The task makes sure a `bin/bun` binstub exists and installs an initializer/task of sorts to ensure both build-related gems use our bundled version of Bun.

Alternatively, you can call the following in one of your project's rakefiles:

```ruby
Bundlebun::Integrations::Cssbundling.bun!
Bundlebun::Integrations::Jsbundling.bun!
```

#### vite-ruby and vite-rails

[vite-ruby](https://github.com/ElMassimo/vite_ruby) and [vite-rails](https://vite-ruby.netlify.app/) are gems that make Ruby and Rails integration with [Vite](https://vite.dev/), a great JavaScript build tool and platform, seamless and easy.

The bundlebun integration would be installed automatically, or you can run:

```sh
rake bun:install:vite
```

That will make sure you have a `bin/bun` binstub.

Next, we'll install a custom `bin/vite` binstub (otherwise, ruby-vite won't be able to sense bundlebun presence); the original file, if present, would be backed up to `bin/vite-backup`.

Finally, we'll put an initializer that forces vite-ruby to use bundlebun. Alternatively, you can call this yourself:

```ruby
Bundlebun::Integrations::ViteRuby.bun!
```

#### ExecJS

[ExecJS](https://github.com/rails/execjs) runs JavaScript code straight from Ruby. To do so, it supports a bunch of runtimes it can launch—and get a result. The Bun runtime already exists for ExecJS; we just need to ensure it uses the bundled one.

The bundlebun integration can be installed automatically, or you can run:

```sh
rake bun:install:execjs
```

This will create an initializer to redefine the Bun runtime for ExecJS and force its usage to be default. Alternatively, you can call:

```ruby
Bundlebun::Integrations::ExecJS.bun!
```

### Notes on `gem install`

bundlebun is designed to be used with Bundler: installed in specific projects, and launched via `bin/bun` or integrations.

If you install the gem globally, you _won't see the `bun` executable_ as a wrapper for a Ruby-bundled Bun runtime; instead, it would be called `bundlebun`.

This naming discrepency is to avoid possible conflicts in your `$PATH` if you have an independent Bun runtime installed: if the directory with Ruby gem-generated binstubs is in your `$PATH` before the directory with your Bun runtime, running `bun` will launch the bundlebun's version, causing a lot of confusion. And that is why bundlebun is _not_ greedy with the `bun` executable name. If you wish to run Bun runtime globally using this gem, a simple symlink or a wrapper script will do, but the gem won't act destructively.

## Usage

### Binstub

The easiest way to interact with bundled Bun is via the binstub at `bin/bun`; it will launch the bundled version of Bun with the arguments provided:

```sh
> bin/bun
Bun is a fast JavaScript runtime, package manager, bundler, and test runner. (1.1.38+bf2f153f5)

Usage: bun <command> [...flags] [...args]

...
```

### Return codes

Note that with this (or any other option to run Bun), bundlebun will return the error code `127` if the executable is not found.

### Rake

Alternatively, you can use a Rake task. The syntax is far from perfect, but that's a limitation of Rake. You need to add quotes around the parameters and put them into square brackets. If you cannot install the binstub, though, might be your option.

```
rake bun[command]  # Run bundled Bun with parameters
```

```sh
> rake "bun[outdated]"
bun outdated v1.1.38 (bf2f153f)
...
```

### Ruby

**Check bundlebun API: https://rubydoc.info/gems/bundlebun**.

The easiest way to call Bun from Ruby would be `Bundlebun.call`:

```ruby
Bundlebun.call("outdated") # => `bun outdated`
Bundlebun.call(["add", "postcss"]) # => `bun add postcss`
```

Check out the [API documentation](https://rubydoc.info/gems/bundlebun) on `Bundlebun::Runner` for helper methods. Some of the most useful ones:

- `Bundlebun::Runner.binary_path`: returns the full path to the bundled Bun library.
- `Bundlebun::Runner.binary_path_exist?`: checks if that binary even exists.
- `Bundlebun::Runner.binstub_exist?`: checks if the binstub exists.
- `Bundlebun::Runner.binstub_or_binary_path`: returns the optimal way to run bundled Bun: a path to binstub or a full path to the binary.

## Versioning

bundlebun uses the `#{bundlebun.version}.#{bun.version}` versioning scheme. Meaning: gem bundlebun version `0.1.0.1.1.38` is a distribution that includes a gem with its own code version `0.1.0` and a Bun runtime with version `1.1.38`.

bundlebun is designed to automatically push new gem versions when there is a new Bun release. That said, you can lock the exact version number in your `Gemfile`, or leave the version unspecified and update it as you wish.

## Uninstall

To uninstall, remove the gem:

```sh
bundle remove bundlebun
```

Or remove it from your `Gemfile` and run bundler.

Next, remove the integrations you have in place:

- `bin/bun`
- Delete `bin/vite` if exists or restore it from `bin/vite-backup`
- Delete `tasks/bundlebun.rake` if exists
- Delete `config/initializers/bundlebun-vite.rb` if exists
- Delete `config/initializers/bundlebun-execjs.rb` if exists
- Search for `bin/bun` mentions in your code and configs
- Search for `Bundlebun` mentions in your code.
